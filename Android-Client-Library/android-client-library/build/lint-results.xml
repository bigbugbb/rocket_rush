        id="DefaultLocale"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Implicitly using the default locale is a common source of bugs: Use toLowerCase(Locale) instead"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Finds calls to locale-ambiguous `String` manipulation methods"
        explanation="Calling `String#toLowerCase()` or `#toUpperCase()` *without specifying an explicit locale* is a common source of bugs. The reason for that is that those methods will use the current locale on the user&apos;s device, and even though the code appears to work correctly when you are developing the app, it will fail in some locales. For example, in the Turkish locale, the uppercase replacement for `i` is *not* `I`.

If you want the methods to just perform ASCII replacement, for example to convert an enum name, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.US)` instead. If you really want to use the current locale, call `String#toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault())` instead."

        message="Old buildToolsVersion; recommended version is 19.0.3 or later"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="4"
        summary="Looks for old or obsolete Gradle library dependencies"
        explanation="This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find."
